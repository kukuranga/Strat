//----BUGS---//

-Movement, when the unit can move 2 spaces but the closest one is not moveable make it
	stop the movement ability pased that point

-Combat, Attacks dont work as intended.
	- simplify the combat more, take away the attack and auto attack ranges for each unit on separate scripts
	- attacks should work simply. 
	- if the unit is in range of an anemy attack the enemy
	- only if the unit is not moving
	- only if the unit can attack
	- only if the unit is in range
	
	-to simplyfy attacks remove attack scriptable object logic and move it to the character
	as a virtual method to be created by each individual unit.
	-Auto attack should also be in the base character script and should just check the range for an enemy

//---TODO--//
